A simple chat app written in Rust using [Rocket](https://rocket.rs)

# Running
Thats easy. You just need [**Rust**](https://rust-lang.org) and **git**.

Then get the source code over git
```
> git clone https://github.com/Platinum-Phoenix/RustChatApp ChatApp
```

After that just run
```
> cd ChatApp
> cargo run
```

That should startup the server on **localhost:3000**
